# Personal dotfiles

User-specific application configuration is traditionally stored in
so-called [dotfiles][1] (files whose filename starts with a dot). This
repository contains my personal dotfiles. It is recommended to use these
dotfiles in combination with [mydwm][2] and [myst][3].

The `install.sh` script automates the configuration process. Edit it to
match your local setup.
